The bugbuster.py script is a tiny Python script that wraps around
two well known static analyzers, the splint static analyzer and the
TenDRA compiler static checker. It has various options that will
allow you to easily manage error message from the compile command
under Emacs or VIM.


It searches for the configuration file on the current directory
as ./.bugbuster.ini and it has the following options:

[global]
includes = /usr/include/libxml2:/usr/include/python2.7 # include dirs
suppress = true # suppress external files other than the processed file
defaults = tendra:splint # default static checkers

[tendra]
flags = -Yxpg4:-Yposix2:-Yposix:-Xs # flags passed to TenDRA
ignore = preprocessing:aborting # ignore errors containing...

[splint]
flags = -bugslimit:100 # flags passed to splint
ignore = exported:observer # ignore errors containing...

It also has the same options for the command line processing. Please
execute:

bugbuster.py --help

To take a look on the available options.
